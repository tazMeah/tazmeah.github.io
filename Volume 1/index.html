            We are using Yahweh or Yahveh as the correct name. Through our research
            we have found that it is spelled both ways, and also Yahvah, all meaning
            the same thing, the TRUE NAME of THE FATHER.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            YAHWEH, the proper name of the God of Israel; it is composed of four
            consonants (YHWH) in Hebrew and is therefore called the tetragrammaton.
            (TETRAGRAMMATON, the four-lettered name for the Hebrew God pronounced
            Jehovah through misapplication, dating back to 1270, of the vowels of
            Adonai (Lord) to the consonants J, H, V, H.). The correct pronounciation
            is Yahweh.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            Also we have used many different versions of the Bible (but in all the
            versions, we are using the Correct Name). Wherever we feel it is
            necessary, we have indicated which Bible we are using by the following
            abbreviations. Otherwise, you may assume we have used the King James
            Version or the Holy Name Bible. The Holy Name Bible used the Scofield
            Reference Bible as a foundation. A full explanation of the Holy Name
            Bible, by A.B. Traina will be found on Page 107, Volume 1, of this book.
            An analysis of the True Name by Emma Zarneke will be found on page 105.

        <h3 class="text-center mb-5 mt-5 text-decoration-underline">ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</h3>


        <p class="text-indent">Shortly after I had received this stupendous and panoramic vision from Yahweh in 1931, I
            sat
            down with a paper tablet and pencils and attempted to put into writing that which I had seen and heard in
            the
            vision, but very shortly I abandoned my efforts for I realized that it was too much of a job for me alone to
            tackle. I did, however, manage to have charts drawn of my vision, being aided by my now deceased son, R. P.
            Kinley, and other enlightened students, and these charts have been of invaluable assistance in the
            edification
            of a fairly large number of people. These pictorial illustrations have also put to silence those who would
            say
            that I did not have a vision, for if one examines and understands the simplicity of these charts, he cannot
            help
            but come to a profound knowledge of Yahweh and His Purpose and Plan. Furthermore, these charts have been in
            the
            Universities, Colleges, Seminaries and virtually all over the world, and there has been no one to date that
            has
            been able to refute this work.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">In the year of 1961, I did manage, with the incalculable contribution of a few
            dependable,
            steadfast, and devoted disciples, to get this message into print, and I am herewith doffing my hat to these
            dedicated souls.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">Dr. Carl F. Gross has been my companion in the Faith for the past thirty-six years, and
            without his devoted services, I do not see how I would have made it. He is possessed of tireless patience,
            virtue not seen very often, and has the other rare quality of being able to do almost anything that one
            might
            request of him. He has labored unceasingly in getting this work into print for the second time, especially
            in
            the matter of the drawing of charts, editing and composition. Lena Gross, Dr. Gross’ secretary has been a
            constant help and encouragement.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">Dr. Robert Harris, a physician, came to me in the year 1957 and has been constantly by my
            side ever since; for he soon realized the valuable role he had to play in correlating the physical body to
            the
            Divine three-fold Pattern of the Tabernacle given to Moses in Mount Sinai, proving that man is made in the
            likeness and image of Elohim. Dr. Harris’ writings are an indispensable and necessary adjunct to this work,
            and
            I greatly appreciate his noble efforts and sincere devotion.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">Mrs. Mary Gross is a rare person, indeed, for with tireless energy, she has typed and
            re-typed this book many times over, and has worked at a thousand other chores as my secretary. Many times I
            felt
            that she was at the point of complete physical and mental exhaustion, but somehow she would rally, and again
            tackle her many duties with renewed vigor and stamina. Words cannot express my sincere thankfulness to her
            for a
            job well done.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">Dr. Dennis Droulard came to me from the Jehovah Witness faith, and their loss is my gain,
            for
            he has certainly been a boon to the publishing of this second edition of Elohim The Archetype (Original)
            Pattern
            Of The Universe. At a great personal sacrifice, he quit his job, so that he might devote his specialized
            energies to this job. It has been his know-how that has been most singularly responsible for organizing,
            editing, designing, and general managing of the multifarious job of publishing this book.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">Mrs. Marion Harris, the companion of Dr. Harris, has had her hands full also, for she has
            had
            to type all of Dr. Harris’ writings, and assist Mrs. Gross with correspondence and other work. Frankly
            speaking,
            I do not see how she was able to do anything in assisting with this work, realizing the arduous role that a
            physician’s wife has to play.
        </p>

    <div class="page">

        <p class="text-indent">Dr. Bernard Durham, an accomplished pianist and musician, was added to the fold not many
            months ago, but his presence has certainly been felt by everyone. He has not only added to the joy and
            happiness of our group by his musical renditions but contributed to the work of this book by closely working
            with me in composition and typing. We would sometimes labor over one sentence for many days before we were
            satisfied with its structure. He has been of great benefit to me in this worthwhile endeavor.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">There are many others of The Institute of Divine Metaphysical Research, Inc., but space
            will not permit us here to list all the people of the Institute who have helped and the ones who have
            sincerely desired to help and be a part of this work.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">I sincerely thank each and everyone of these for the valuable part that he played in
            making this volume a reality, and thereby bestowing their love upon all who will read and understand the
            message of this book.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center mb-5 mt-5 text-decoration-underline">PREFACE</h3>

        <p class="text-indent">In the eight year period since the first edition of this book, “God, The Archetype
            (Original) Pattern Of The Universe” was published in October, 1961, there have been many momentous,
            prophecy- fulfilling events and happenings to come to pass. All of these events have brought the whole world
            nearer to disaster and ruin, and have been an omen of the end of this world, and the inevitable revelation
            of Yahshua the Messiah from heaven. Men, everywhere, are fearful and trembling in anticipation of some
            devastating and cataclysmic holocaust and are hurriedly holding councils and endless meetings trying to get
            things patched up, and thereby avoid or escape their doom. They are altogether ignorant of what is happening
            in the world and why, for they know absolutely nothing of the Eternal Purpose and Plan of Yahweh. If they
            were knowledgeable of Yahweh’s Purpose and Plan, they would understand that everything that is taking place
            in the world is a fulfillment of His Words and the Scriptures contained in the Holy Bible. They would
            further understand that there is nothing that any man can do to obstruct, hinder or impede the carrying out
            of our Eternal Creator’s will and pre- determined counsel (Isaiah 46:9-10).</p>
        <p class="text-indent">When one takes a good look at the present world situation, he finds that there is hardly
            any political, ecclesiastical, scientific or social institution, racial or ethnic group, or geographical
            location that has escaped involvement in the violent and turbulent changes that are transpiring in the
            world. The Roman Catholic Church, that great bastion and citadel of Christianity has fallen “flatter than a
            fritter;” the present day Roman Catholic Church would not be recognized by any of its past rulers and
            adherents if they were raised from the dead, and they would be utterly shocked to see the ruin and dismal
            decline of the once proud lady of religious demagoguery. The death of Pope Pius XII marked the end of the
            old order of religious tyrants, and ecclesiastical bondage, and the succession and reign of Pope John XXIII
            marked a transitional period in which the long held customs, tenets and traditions of Roman Catholicism
            began to shake and tremble. The convening of the Second Vatican Council on October 11, 1962, and the
            succession to the papal throne of Pope Paul VI began to put the finishing touches, and to signal the death
            knell of Christendom’s loftiest constituent. It should be categorically declared that the 1961 publication
            of “Elohim The Archetype (Original) Pattern Of The Universe” and its perusal by these Popes, Cardinals,
            Archbishops, and laity has been responsible for the profound changes that have taken place in the Roman
            Catholic Church, for this work exposed and revealed the satanic workings of this organization; and they have
            been feverishly trying to rectify the obvious errors and foolish blunders that mark their organization as
            the modern day Babylon. There is chaos and confusion, and a definite schism in the Roman Catholic Church,
            and many thousands of laymen, priests, and even Jesuits have left the ranks of the church in open defiance
            to the Pope and the ruling hierarchy, and have started underground churches. These have expressed openly
            their disgust and discontent with the Pope’s rulings on birth control, the demotion of saints, the
            participation of priests and bishops in the decision-making policies of the church, and his forbiddance of
            the priests to marry.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">All of these events have happened to the Roman Catholic Church in fulfillment of the
            prophecies of John the Revelator in his vision on the Isle of Patmos as recorded in the 17th and 18th
            chapters of the Book of Revelations. It was and is absolutely necessary that Satan be revealed or exposed
            before Yahshua the Messiah is revealed from Heaven taking flaming vengeance on those who know not Yahweh.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">The protestant faiths, too, are implicated in this religious and theological
            deceitfulness for they are guilty of the same practices and errors of the mother church. They are busily
            trying to join ranks thinking that there is strength in numbers, and they openly admit that the number of
            their divisions is appalling and disgusting. Their congregations are also dwindling and one does not have to
            go far before he finds a church building for sale, for they are suffering also from the same spiritual
            wickedness and desolation of abomination, and are being cast down.</p>
    </div>

    <!--------------------------- page ------------------------------->

    <div class="page">
        <p class="text-indent">Likewise, the political organizations of the world have suffered decline and
            embarrassment and frustrations; countries have gone off of their gold standards and faced economic ruin
            while other world renown governments have been stubbornly resisted by small insignificant countries in armed
            conflict. Political heads of governments have stepped down from their high posts in disdain or been ousted
            or assassinated, and civil strife in the streets, and on the campuses of Universities is rampant, with no
            one having any answers as to why these things should be or as to the ultimate end of these upheavals.
            Nations have armed themselves to the teeth with devastating and destructive nuclear weapons, and are
            nervously watching one another in order to be the first to push the button to release these terrible
            instruments of war for they fully realize that the one that strikes first would have a decided advantage.
            So, we all sit like ducks on a dry powder keg awaiting the inevitable spark that will blow us all into total
            oblivion.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">To further add to the chaos and confusion in the world, there is strife and blood-shed
            between racial groups, the blacks versus the whites, the yellows versus the reds, the Jews versus the Arabs,
            etc. Brother is fighting against brother, father against son and mother against daughter, the young against
            the old, and everywhere there is utter chaos and disorder. The Jew-Arab situation seems to be the classical
            example of such conflict, and it is potentially explosive enough to lead the whole world into armed
            aggression. Neither the Jewish nations or the Arab nations will even mention that Yahweh in His ultimate
            Purpose and Plan gave the land of Canaan, over which they are now fighting, to both nations as an
            inheritance. They do know enough, however, to keep the United Nations out of the role of mediator for they
            fully realize that the U.N. knows nothing of the Promise made to Abraham the father of both Isaac and
            Ishmael. Both nations of people would rather fight to the last man then to give Yahweh the glory and honor
            of recognizing His Will and His Way.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">The matter of the young people and teenagers uprising needs special mentioning as these
            youngsters have come to the realization of the hypocrisy of Christendom, and of their parents and have
            openly revolted against them. They have no further confidence in the government, their church, their
            teaching institutions or their parents, and rather than to be a hypocrite, they have just given themselves
            over to whatsoever they willed. They take drugs openly and defiantly, they make love openly, they dress as
            they desire, and raise hell whenever they choose. They are not shackled by any morals, laws or religious
            dogmas. It must be said for them, that most of them are too honest to be a hypocrite.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">It is in the climate of the above-mentioned conditions that this second edition of
            “Elohim The Archetype (Original) Pattern Of The Universe,” is being published, and hopefully we are
            endeavoring to reach the masses of the people who are in the doldrums of despair and hell. No, there can be
            no drawing back from the inevitable destruction of the world for Yahweh has purposed it to be so, but it is
            possible for one to free himself from the bondage of sin and ignorance, and to come into the ark of safety
            in the glorious liberty of the Sons of Yahweh. No one in his right mind could think that the world is going
            to go on and on and that eventually, peace and harmony would prevail, for this has never been the case
            except for very short periods of time since man has been upon the face of the earth. It is the mercifulness
            of Yahweh to provide a way of escape out of this doomed world and we should be eternally grateful to Him for
            this precious salvation.</p>

        <p class="text-indent">
            The sum total of these written volumes, expresses my true revealed “UNDERSTANDING” of Yahweh- Elohim and the
            Creation as it is recorded in the Holy Bible, and in reference to Yahshua the Messiah, the true “SON OF
            YAHWEH,”
            and Satan, or the Anti-Messiah, the true “SON OF PERDITION.” Yet, this understanding is not of my own
            private
            and independently conceived imagination. In the month of June and year of 1931, I, Henry Clifford Kinley,
            was
            caused to behold a great Panoramic Vision, and on the same day I also in turn received the Divine Revelation
            of
            Spiritual meaning of the Vision. It is this simplified Panoramic Vision and Revelation of the Divine Pattern
            of
            the Universe, given to me by Yahweh-Elohim, which I have expounded upon, through charts and writings to my
            associates which in turn has qualified them to detect, identify, and to prove the existence of Yahweh, and
            the
            Satanic Mystery of Iniquity, and to trace the Mark of the Beast from its origin to its final conclusion, the
            Lake of Fire.
        </p>

        <p class="text-indent">
            This is a more comprehensible elucidation of the first and probably the last manuscript that I will write in
            my
            lifetime, as pertaining to Yahweh and His Ultimate Purpose which has functioned down through the past and
            the
            present Dispensations and Ages, and will continue to operate through the Dispensations and Ages yet to come.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            This great and powerfully psychological experience revealed Yahweh-Elohim to me for the first time in my
            life;
            revealed Him as He really EXISTS, being the ONE and ONLY UNIVERSAL SPIRIT and ARCHETYPAL PATTERN OF THE
            UNIVERSE. In presenting and explaining this stupendous “Vision and Revelation” to you, the reader, I presume
            that YOU are honest, sincere and earnest in your extensive and intensified search for the TRUE YAHWEH OF THE
            UNIVERSE. I further assume, that you, like millions of other human beings in every walk of life throughout
            the
            world, truly want to KNOW YAHWEH our ELOHIM as He really IS and as He ACTUALLY EXISTS. Our only purpose in
            writing this book is to try to help you FIND and KNOW Yahweh our Elohim for your own personal satisfaction
            and
            consolation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            Although, my purpose, as expressed above, is to help every person who reads this book to LEARN OF THE TRUTH
            and
            FIND and KNOW Yahweh, I cannot definitely guarantee that in every case I will succeed in my efforts. The
            ONLY
            possibility of this becoming a truly accomplished realization in your life as it is in mine and
            comparatively
            few others, lies solely within your own ability and power to accept attested TRUTH and SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN
            FACTS. I shall present pure, unadulterated TRUTH and FACTS to you as they REALLY ARE for your careful
            investigation and consideration.

            physical and spiritual. Sometimes, stopping and thinking for a moment over the essential things of life
            eliminates many regretted years of poverty, sickness, humiliation, embarrassment sometimes, death and
            destruction. Therefore, we should learn to pause and TRY TO THINK INTELLIGENTLY before we finally conclude
            affirmatively or negatively. We should do this before an ultimatum or final decision is rendered on any

            have become infinite in wisdom and infallible in judgment, or that I have already attained that state of
            absolute perfection in every technical detail. However, I am only trying to attract your attention and
            elevate your MIND so that I can impart to you the TRUE UNDERSTANDING of the Vision which I received by
            Divine Revelation. In view of this, the Pictorial Illustrations and explanations of the Vision herein set

            great Panoramic Vision and Divine Revelation was originally intended for YOU as much as it was for me.

            As heretofore stated, the REVELATION of the ARCHETYPAL PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSE embraces the EXISTENCE OF
            YAHWEH, HIS UNIVERSAL SPIRIT LAW and ETERNAL PURPOSE through the Dispensations and Ages. Comparatively
            speaking, this is a new Divine, Philosophical, Scientific, Spiritual, Scriptural and Revolutionary
            “interpretation” of the Holy Bible. It is supported by a definite DIVINE PATTERN and PLAN, “descriptively”
            stipulated in the Scriptures of the Holy Bible itself (Exodus 25:40; Hebrews 8:5; I Chronicles 28:19; John
            2:19-21). This interpretation is discretely confirmed in every polytechnical detailed manner by the
            UNIVERSAL CREATION OF ELOHIM, both corporeal and incorporeal, visible and invisible (Romans 1:19-20).
            Moreover, I firmly BELIEVE that this Vision and Revelation is to be regarded as ONE of the greatest and most
            astounding of PANORAMIC VISIONS and REVELATIONS ever given to mankind since the CREATION of the material or

            explain its true meaning to Religious Teachers, Philosophers, Scientists and Medical Doctors. No man, Jew,
            Gentile, Roman Catholic, Protestant, or Teachers of Philosophy and other Scientific or Cosmic phases of
            nature, who have HEARD and UNDERSTOOD the explanation of the “DIVINE ARCHETYPE PATTERN” and the Universal
            Spirit Law embodied therein and His operation shown by the illustrative charts, has ever been able to refute

            A profound KNOWLEDGE and UNDERSTANDING of this Divine Panoramic Vision, operating first in the realm of

            ALL practiced forms and classifications of SUPERSTITIONS, WILLFUL IGNORANCE, SATANIC (or false) DOCTRINES or

            the Old Covenant with
            Israel. Further, this teaching INVESTIGATES the cosmographical structure of the Universe and the unexplained
            so-called Law of Nature, which in REALITY, is Universal Spirit Law, the powers latent in man, and teaches
            mankind of his INSEPARABLE relationship with Yahweh-Elohim and to have implicit “FAITH” in Yahweh-Elohim and
            worship Him in SPIRIT and in TRUTH (John 4:24, KJV); as Yahweh-Elohim had originally intended, according to
            His Eternal Purpose (Ephesians 1:9-12, KJV).

        <p class="text-indent">
            Furthermore, since the Scriptures teach us that man is made in the Likeness and Image of Elohim and he (the
            man) is willing to confess that he knows very little about the anatomy and physiology of his own body, which
            he has had all his life; HOW THEN could we expect him to know Yahweh-Elohim as He actually exists and as He
            really is? (See correlation of the physical body to the Divine Pattern by Robert Harris, M.D., Ph.D., D.D.,
            volume 3 in this book).

            It may seem to you that this is the long way around, but in reality it is the short way, when you STOP and
            consider that Yahweh-Elohim in His New Covenant, has promised to put His Law in our heart and write it in
            our mind and cause us to “Know Him” and walk in His Way, that is, deliver us from the Ignorance of Sin and
            Preserve us for Eternal Life and Immortal Glorification (Jeremiah 31:31-34; II Corinthians 3:1-4). Yahshua
            said, “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you,
            and LEARN of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls: For my yoke is
            EASY, and my burden is LIGHT” (Matthew 11:28-30). It is of this Vision and Revelation that you shall read in
            the succeeding pages.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            Yahshua the Messiah charged His disciples after His resurrection from the grave as a Quickening Spirit (I
            Cor. 15:45) to “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing (or immersing) them in the Name of the
            Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
            commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the age (or world)” - (Matthew 28:19-20).
            Therefore, it has been the Holy Spirit which is Yahshua the Messiah or the Comforter (John 14:26) in those
            who are preaching the True Gospel of the Kingdom that has really done the preaching all down through this
            Present Age of Grace since Pentecost. We, therefore, having this ministry (II Corinthians 4:1-6), have had
            the awesome responsibility to see to it that “this True Gospel of Yahshua be preached in all the world for a
            witness unto all nations, and then shall the end (of the world or Age) come” (Matt. 24:14). Accordingly, we
            have gone on three (3) Ecclesiastical Peace Missions in the past five (5) years and have met with religious
            and political heads and expounded unto them this Gospel. The breakdown is as follows:

            We boldly spoke the Truth to these religious heads and told them of their errors regarding the True Name of

            Pattern of the Universe which is Yahweh-Elohim and which was given to Moses as the Tabernacle Pattern

            Hebrews 8:5); of their error in saying that Yahshua (whom they call Jesus) came to set up a Christian
            example for us to follow, and that He was instituting carnal ordinances e.g., water baptism, Lord’s Suppers,
            etc., for us to follow, whereas He (Yahshua) said that He came to FULFILL such carnal ordinances (Matthew
            3:13-15; Matthew 5:1,17-18; Luke 24:44-45); of their error in saying that Yahshua has gone away into Heaven
            to prepare a place (the Kingdom) for us whereas, He is really tabernacling in our physical bodies as a
            quickening Spirit (Colossians 1:26-27). These and a lot of other serious spiritual errors were pointed out
            to these ecclesiastical giants and no serious denial was forthcoming from any of them. We noticed one
            particular thing throughout our journeying and that is that the common folk everywhere are hungry for the
            Real, Genuine Truth and recognize immediately when it is preached unto them, especially in some of the under
            developed countries of Africa.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            Having preached the True Gospel of Yahshua the Messiah throughout the world, we therefore know that the end
            of this world or Age is not far off since according to Matthew 24:14, the end would not come until such time
            as it was preached. This is also a witness to the fact that Christendom and the other religious beliefs are
            not the True Gospel as they have been preached throughout the world for a long time and the end has not
            come.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            We have a further witness in the fact that our Founder, Dr. Henry Clifford Kinley, the man to whom this
            stupendous, Divine Vision and Revelation was given in the year 1931, and who preached this True Gospel for
            forty-five (45) years has now taken off the flesh as of February 9, 1976 and we all know that according to
            the Divine Purpose and Pattern that we must follow very shortly by taking off the flesh, also, as the
            Apostle Paul said, “Behold, I show you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a
            moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be
            raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
            mortal must put on immortality” (I Corinthians 15:51-53). There is no one that is going to Heaven or Hell in
            this physical body, as flesh and blood does not inherit the Kingdom of Yahweh (I Corinthians 15:50). As of
            now, we are supposed to have Yahshua the Messiah who is a Quickening Eternal Spirit abiding in these mortal
            bodies and it is the Eternal Spirit that will change our vile, physical body into a glorious spiritual body
            as Yahshua the Messiah who only at this time has an Immortal Spiritual Body (Philippians 3:20-21; I Timothy
            6:16). Even those who have passed on have not obtained this glorious body but are waiting for that moment
            when they shall be changed right along with us (Revelation 6:9; Hebrews 11:39-40).
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent">
            And one more thing needs to be understood and that is that Yahweh is mercifully saving a few more souls
            right in the closing prophetic moments of this age — not a great number, but a remnant, and we have seen
            this manifested as new souls are being added unto the Spiritual Body or Congregation of Yahshua the Messiah
            every day. Since it is Yahweh who is saving these souls through His Son, Yahshua the Messiah, He is opening
            up their understanding right now, and it does not take them a long time to comprehend the Truth as it did
            some of us older ones. Nevertheless, whether we come to an understanding over night or over a long period of
            time, all praises and glory and honor belong unto our Heavenly Father, Yahweh, for this blessing.

            and PURPOSE through the Dispensations and Ages. Comparatively speaking, this is a NEW and REVOLUTIONARY
            SCRIPTURAL TEACHING which embraces the fields of COSMOGONY, ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, PHILOSOPHY,
            GENERAL SCIENCE and ESCHATOLOGY, to mention only a few. This TEACHING is Spiritually transforming the CARNAL

                wrote the Pentateuch (Law). Later ELOHIM appeared to the Prophets, who wrote the books of the Prophets,

                REMEMBER, there IS NONE OTHER NAME under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved, neither is
                there salvation in any other NAME, saving THE NAME OF YAHSHUA THE MESSIAH (Acts 4:10-12).

                Step 4.
            </p>
            <p>
                We MUST REALIZE that without a workable KNOWLEDGE and CORRECT INTERPRETATION of what is WRITTEN in the
                Law and Prophets (Isaiah 8:20), it is IMPOSSIBLE for you to know anything definite about Yahweh our
                Elohim and His Purpose. Therefore, Yahshua the Messiah told the Rabbinical Scribes and Pharisees of His
                day to “SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES (<span class="u">not</span> <span class="u">the</span> <span
                    class="u">tradition</span> <span class="u">of</span> <span class="u">the</span> <span

            text-decoration-style: double;">
                Step 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                We MUST REALIZE that Yahshua the Messiah said, ”ELOHIM IS SPIRIT; and they that worship Him MUST WORSHIP
                HIM IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH” (John 4:24, H.N.B.). “Hear O Israel: Yahweh our Elohim IS YAHWEH A UNITY”
                (Deuteronomy 6:4, H.N.B.). “Endeavouring to keep the UNITY OF THE SPIRIT in the bond of peace. There is
                ONE BODY, and ONE SPIRIT, even as ye are called in ONE HOPE OF YOUR CALLING: ONE ELOHIM, ONE FAITH, ONE
                IMMERSION, ONE IS YAHWEH and FATHER OF ALL, who is above ALL, and through ALL and IN YOU ALL” (Ephesians
                4:3-6, H.N.B., see also chart on Yahweh A Unity, page 31).

                Step 6.
            </p>
            <p>
                We MUST ALSO REALIZE THAT YAHSHUA; “Who is the IMAGE OF THE INVISIBLE EL, the FIRST cause of ALL
                CREATION: For by HIM WERE ALL THINGS CREATED, that are in Heaven, and that are in earth, VISIBLE and
                INVISIBLE, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: ALL THINGS WERE CREATED
                BY HIM, and FOR HIM: and He is BEFORE ALL THINGS, and in HIM ALL THINGS HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY PLACED”
                (Colossians 1:15-17, H.N.B.).

            <p style="text-decoration-line: underline;
            text-decoration-style: double;">
                Step 7.
            </p>
            <p>
                We MUST ALSO REALIZE, that the INVISIBLE things of Yahweh are SEEN and UNDERSTOOD by the VISIBLE things,
                “Because that which MAY BE KNOWN OF YAHWEH IS MANIFEST IN THEM; for Yahweh HATH SHOWED IT UNTO THEM. For
                the INVISIBLE THINGS OF HIM FROM THE CREATION OF THE WORLD ARE CLEARLY SEEN, being UNDERSTOOD BY THE
                THINGS THAT ARE MADE, EVEN HIS ETERNAL POWER and SUPERNAL NATURE; so that THEY ARE WITHOUT EXCUSE”
                (Romans 1:19-20, H.N.B.). For example, David the Psalmist said, “The Heavens declare the Glory of El:
                and the firmament sheweth His handy work. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
                knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Yet their message is gone
                out through all the earth, and their story to the end of the world. In them hath He set a TABERNACLE for
                the sun” (Psalms 19th division, H.N.B.). Yahshua the Messiah said, “If I have told you earthly things,
                and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of Heavenly things” (John 3:12, H.N.B.).

            </p>
            <p>
                We MUST ALSO REALIZE, that “ALL SCRIPTURE (<span class="u">not</span> <span class="u">traditions</span>)
                that is given BY INSPIRATION OF YAHWEH, IS
                PROFITABLE FOR DOCTRINE, FOR REPROOF, FOR CORRECTION, FOR INSTRUCTION IN RIGHTEOUSNESS: that the man of
                Yahweh may be PERFECT, THOROUGHLY FURNISHED UNTO ALL GOOD WORKS” (2 Timothy 3:16- 17, H.N.B.).

            It cannot be reiterated too strongly how vitally important it is for you, the reader, and me, the writer, to
            KNOW and REALIZE what the SCRIPTURES ARE. The Scriptures are (excusing mistranslations and interpolations)
            the ORIGINAL INSPIRED WRITINGS, written by Moses and the Prophets by the Power of the Paternal Yahweh-Elohim
            to manifest Himself, THE CREATION and HIS PURPOSE, through VISIONS and REVELATIONS (see illustration of the

            5:39). The SCRIPTURES are not TRADITION which is an erroneous interpretation of the Scriptures, taught by
            the Rabbinical Scribes and Pharisees (Matthew 15:1-3), and by so-called Christendom today. These Visions
            shown to Moses and the Prophets, reveal Yahweh-Elohim operating in THE DAY or REALM OF ETERNITY, that is,
            BEFORE TIME BEGAN and manifests His activities in the past, present and future Ages, within both the
            Spiritual and Physical creation. The SCRIPTURES (not tradition) including the written REVELATION of the
            Apostle John on the Isle of Patmos, disclose Yahweh and His Purpose from the Beginning to the Ending.

            <p>
                REMEMBER and KNOW that we are using the Heavenly bodily Form of Elohim as the Temple and the Tabernacle
                shown to Moses in Mount Sinai as the Archetype Pattern of the Universe (Exodus 24:9-10; Exodus 25:8-9,
                also picture on cover). Elohim referred David to his body as a Temple (I Chronicles 28:19-20), which we

            </p>
            <p>
                REMEMBER, Moses said, “YAHWEH THY ELOHIM will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of
                thy brethren, like unto me; unto Him ye shall hearken” (Deuteronomy 18:15, H.N.B.). “For unto us a child
                is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulders: and His name shall be
                called Wonderful, Counsellor, of the Mighty El, of The Father of Eternity; The Prince of Peace” (Isaiah

                REMEMBER, Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City, and “after threescore and
                two weeks shall MESSIAH be cut off WITHOUT A SUCCESSOR TO FOLLOW HIM” (Daniel 9:24-26, K.J.V.). “FOR ONE

                REMEMBER, there are two (2) outstanding MYSTERIES IN OPERATION NOW, namely: the MYSTERY OF YAHWEH (I

            </p>
            <p>
                We MUST REALIZE that Yahweh-Elohim promised to put His LAW (the New Testament or Covenant) in the MIND
                and write them in the HEARTS of the house of Israel and the house of Judah AFTER the days of the DEATH,
                BURIAL and RESURRECTION of YAHSHUA THE MESSIAH (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Hebrews 8:8-10). The New Testament or
                Covenant is NOT written with Pen or Ink as in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, etc.; Neither in tables of
                Stone, but in FLESHLY TABLES OF THE HEART BY THE SPIRIT, beginning on the Day of PENTECOST (2
                Corinthians 3:2-3).

            THE ERRONEOUS BELIEF CONCERNING THE SACRED RECORDS
        </h3>
        <p class="text-indent pb-5">
            It is generally believed and quite frequently taught that the Sacred Records of the Creation of Heaven and
            Earth and all that in them is, plus the GENEALOGIES OF MANKIND and the CURRENT EVENTS were uninterruptedly
            transmitted from generation to generation, from Adam to Moses. This transmission of the Sacred Records is
            thought to be possible because of the longevity of the people at that time and that the total elapsed
            chronological period reaching from Adam to the Flood is a relatively short period of 1656 years. From the
            Flood to the Exodus of Israel or to Moses represents a short chronological period of 857 years. The total
            period of time from the CREATION OF ADAM TO MOSES taking into consideration the long-life span of the
            Ante-diluvian Patriarchs and combining the chronological periods involved BEFORE the Flood and AFTER the
            Flood, represents a period of 2513 years, plus seven (7) creative days or years (with Israel) equals 2520.

            The PERSONS involved in the transmission of the Sacred Records according to their theory would be the
            following: (1) ADAM, the FIRST earthly created man (whose wife was Eve) whose total life-span was 930 years,
            begat Cain and Abel and other SONS and DAUGHTERS (Genesis 5:4-5). (2) SETH, the son of ADAM was born in the
            130th year of Adam’s life. The total life-span of Seth was 912 years. (3) ENOCH, the seventh generation from
            Adam was born in the 622nd year after the creation of ADAM and TRANSLATED in the year 987. Enoch was 365
            years old at the time of his TRANSLATION. (4) METHUSELAH, born in the 687th year of Adam’s life was 969
            years old at the time of his death in 1656 A.M., the year of the FLOOD which took place in the 600th year of
            NOAH’S life. (5) NOAH, born in the year 1056 A.M., lived a total life-span of 950 years (and begat three
            sons, SHEM, HAM and JAPHETH) which places his death in the year of 2006 A.M. or 350 years AFTER the FLOOD
            and died in the year 2158 A.M., or 1846 B.Y.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            From the partial genealogical calculation on the preceding page, we can readily SEE and UNDERSTAND that
            Methuselah was born in 687 A.M., and lived 243 years BEFORE the TRANSLATION of ENOCH, 350 years of Noah’s
            life BEFORE the Flood and also 98 years of Shem’s life BEFORE the Flood. Therefore, we can understand how
            the oral or written records could pass from ADAM through SETH, ENOCH and METHUSELAH to NOAH and SHEM in the
            Ante-diluvian Age during the 1656 years from ADAM to the Flood. Skipping the immediate descendants of SHEM,
            the Patriarch, Abraham’s vocation first began to take place about 427 years AFTER the Flood and SHEM died
            502 years AFTER the Flood, which would make the call of Abraham 75 years BEFORE the death of SHEM.
            Therefore, it is quite possible that Shem and Abraham could have become acquainted during the life time of
            Shem and received, in the Post-diluvian Age, the Sacred Records which some of the theologians claim were
            passed from Shem to Abraham.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            It was to Abraham and his seed to whom Yahweh-Elohim had PROMISED the BLESSING. Ishmael was the first son of
            Abraham by Hagar, the bond woman (Gentile), and Isaac was the second son of Abraham, but he (Isaac) was the
            first and only son of ABRAHAM, by Sarah, his FIRST wife (Hebrew). (In Isaac shall thy Seed be called). After
            the death of Sarah, Abraham also had six (6) sons by his second wife KETURAH, namely: 1. Zimran, 2. Jokshan,
            3. Medan, 4. Midian, 5. Ishbak, and 6. Shuah (Genesis 25:1-2). Jacob was the son of Isaac and the father of
            the twelve tribes of Israel whose posterity Moses led out the land of Egypt and the house of bondage, 430
            years AFTER the PROMISE was made. Therefore, from the previous enumeration one can understand why the belief
            has continued through the years that the Sacred Records were given to Abraham and were transmitted from him
            to his son, Isaac, and from Isaac to Jacob, his son, and to the twelve sons of Jacob who transmitted those
            records to Moses. This explanation, then, covers the total chronological period of 2513 years plus 7 years
            equaling 2520 years (7 years as the 7 days of creation), reaching from ADAM to MOSES.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            However, this belief of some Theologians of the transmission of the SACRED RECORDS of the Creation of Heaven
            and Earth and the current events of the Ante-diluvian Age is disputable, in part, because these Medieval and
            Modern Academically trained, Scientific and Philosophical minded Theologians see at a glance that if this
            explanation is accepted it would immediately establish ADAM as the WRITER of the Book of Genesis in which
            was RECORDED many Historical Events which occurred FIVE DAYS prior to ADAM’S creation (Genesis 1:1-26), and
            over two thousand years AFTER his DEATH (Genesis 5:1-5). For this reason in particular, this class of
            Theologians discard the idea that ADAM or any of the Ante-diluvian Patriarchs wrote the Book of Genesis, and
            declare MOSES to be the TRUE INSPIRED WRITER OF THE BOOK in question. This view brings to light another
            GREAT TWO-FOLD COMPLICATED QUESTION.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            If ADAM is to be rejected as the WRITER OF THE BOOK OF GENESIS on the basis that it contains many Historical
            Events which occurred FIVE DAYS BEFORE HIS OWN CREATION and also many other events which occurred OVER TWO
            THOUSAND YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH (the Book of Genesis ends with the death of Joseph), HOW then could Moses
            WRITE the HISTORY OF THE CREATION OF HEAVEN and EARTH and all that in them is, and the current Historical
            Events of the Ante-diluvian Age and a part of the events of the Post-diluvian Age, which occurred over TWO
            THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE HE WAS BORN?

            To further add to the confusion, before we even attempt to answer the great two-fold controversial question,
            we shall state here that there are some Theologians and so-called Scientifical and Biblical Critics that
            believe that there are two cosmological accounts of the Creation contained in the Book of Genesis.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            These so-called Theologians and Scientifical Biblical Critics have declared against Moses as being the
            writer of the so-called two (2) cosmogonies in the Book of Genesis. To defend their convictions, they claim
            that George Smith, Archeologist of the British Museum, unearthed Assyrian Terra-Cotta tablets at Nineveh in
            1875 A.D., which they FALSELY claim are older than Moses’ writing of the Book of Genesis in which they
            further claim, give accounts of the Creation, the Temptation, the Tower of Babel and the FLOOD, virtually
            identical with the Genesis account WHICH WE CLAIM AND PROVE WERE FIRST REVEALED TO MOSES, but they fail to
            tell us WHEN, WHERE or WHO wrote these Tablets. These Bible Critics say that the accounts of Moses were
            copied from the Babylonian account AFTER their captivity to Babylon. (See “The Bible In The Balance” by
            Charles Smith, editor of the Truth Seeker, and see also the Bible Dictionary, article on Cosmogony by Funk
            and Wagnall, page 152. Also see article on Assyro-Babylonian Mythology from Larousse Encyclopedia of
            Mythology, page 49).

            <span class="u">THE GREAT TWO-FOLD CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION IS ANSWERED</span> IN THIS WAY: (1) Yahweh-Elohim
            appeared to the Patriarchs in the Ante-diluvian Age and some of them in the Post- diluvian Age as mentioned
            above, long before the time of Moses by the NAME OF EL SHADDI, but they never WROTE or DOCUMENTED any of
            their communications they had with Him (Exodus 6:3, H.N.B.).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Therefore, no man on earth BEFORE Moses, or at that time, except JOSHUA, the son of NUN, Moses’ Minister
            (Exodus 24:13, H.N.B.), knew the TRUE NAME of the Father, YAHWEH our ELOHIM, but Moses, ALONE to whom Yahweh
            introduced Himself at the BURNING BUSH in the Wilderness of Sinai (Exodus 3:2-8, H.N.B.). Therefore, the
            NAME, YAHWEH our ELOHIM appears in the Book of Genesis many times, which PROVES beyond question that Moses
            DID WRITE THE BOOK OF GENESIS, AFTER the EXODUS of the Israelites from Egypt (see pictures and illustrations
            on page 13).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (2) Let it here be known that Moses had three (3) distinct experiences with Yahweh-Elohim speaking or
            calling unto him from the Mount as follows and in this order:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            1. YAHWEH-ELOHlM (the FIRST time) called Moses up into the mount and spoke to him from out of the mount and
            gave him instructions and warnings concerning the children of Israel, giving them three days to clean up and
            gather around the mount, before He spoke and gave the Ten Commandment Law (see the 19th chapter of Exodus).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            2. YAHWEH again (the SECOND time) called Moses up into the mount in the midst of the CLOUD in which he was
            given the tables of stone with the Ten Commandment Law written thereon, showed unto him the VISION of the
            TABERNACLE and the creation of the Heavens and Earth in logical sequence of Six Solar Days, and Moses was in
            the mount forty days and forty nights (see the 24th chapter of Exodus and also Chart on Creation shown to
            Moses, page 18).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            3. YAHWEH said unto Moses (the THIRD time), Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the FIRST: and I will
            write upon these tables the words that were in the FIRST tables which thou broke. And be ready in the
            morning and come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount
            (see Exodus 34:1-2, H.N.B.). Moses went up into the mount, “And he was there with Yahweh forty days and
            forty nights; he did neither eat bread nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the
            covenant, the Ten Commandments” Exodus 34:28, see also Chart on Genealogies shown to Moses his third trip,
            page 21).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            We are here concerned with the VISIONS Moses received while in the mount the SECOND and THIRD TIMES (as
            related above) which together comprise the BOOK OF GENESIS.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (a) Moses ALONE (the SECOND time he was called into the mount as related above in number 2), SAW THE VISION
            OF ELOHIM, the Archetype (Original) Pattern of the Universe, in the process of creating the Heavens and
            Earth (or the Greater and more Perfect Tabernacle, which is the Universe), in logical sequence of SIX SOLAR
            DAYS, and RESTING on the SABBATH or SEVENTH DAY as related in the first part of the Book of Genesis (which
            is Moses record of the VISIONS while in the mount, Ex. 24:16).

            (b) He also thereafter (while still In the mount) SAW the VISION of the TABERNACLE (Exodus 25:8-9,40); he
            saw also the BOOK written by Yahweh (Exodus 32:32-33; Revelation 20:12-15), and RECEIVE the LAW OF
            COMMANDMENTS written with the finger of Elohim on Tables of Stone which Moses THREW DOWN AND BROKE, after he
            saw that the children of Israel had made a golden calf, when he descended from the mount the SECOND TIME.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (c) ELOHIM told Moses to hew out two Tables of Stone LIKE UNTO THE FIRST TABLES, BEFORE he was called into
            the mount the THIRD time (as related in number 3), after which he received his KNOWLEDGE of the Edenic
            Transgression and Adamic expulsion and genealogies of mankind, except Melchisedec, King and Priest of Salem,
            and the Historical Events of the Ante-diluvian Age which NONE of the Patriarchs from the time of Adam could
            write as mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs (Exodus 34:1- 2).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (d) YAHWEH-ELOHIM spoke to Moses in the wilderness from within the BURNING BUSH about Amram, his father,
            Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (Exodus 3:2-6), which shows that this KNOWLEDGE OF THE GENEALOGIES and PEDIGREES of
            the Patriarchs was by VISION AND DIVINE INSPIRATION.

            AFTER they came out of Egypt, KNEW anything about the gathering of Manna SIX DAYS and the keeping of the
            SABBATH or SEVENTH DAY (REST, Exodus 16:26). Thereafter, in the third month (Sivan) when Yahweh spoke and
            gave the Commandments from Mount Sinai, He REMINDED them to “REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY TO KEEP IT HOLY”
            (Exodus 20:8, see also and compare Genesis 1:31-34 with Exodus 24:16, H.N.B. or Genesis 2:1-4 with Exodus
            24:16, K.J.V., which is further PROOF that Moses beyond a question DID WRITE THE BOOK OF GENESIS, AFTER THE

            As the time drew near for YAHWEH-ELOHIM to make the necessary preparations to deliver the Children of Israel
            out of the land of Egypt according to the PROMISE He (as El Shaddi or the Almighty Provider) had made to
            Abraham and his Seed, or Isaac and Jacob, Yahweh-Elohim raised up Moses to deliver the Children of Israel,
            who were the posterity of Jacob, from the Egyptian bondage.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Moses, born in Egypt of his parents, Amram and Jochebed in 1570 B.Y., at which time Pharaoh, the Egyptian
            King had instructed the midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, to destroy all the male children of the Hebrews,
            because they were multiplying faster than the Egyptians (Exodus 1:15-16). Moses’ mother, Jochebed hid and
            nursed him in her own house for three months, realizing she could hide him no longer, made an Ark and put
            him in it and placed it in the bulrushes of the River Nile, while Moses’ sister Miriam stood in a secret
            place and watched the performance. When Pharaoh’s daughter came to bathe herself in the river, she heard the
            child (Moses) cry and she retrieved him from the water and decided to keep him for herself. Moses’ sister
            Miriam approached Pharaoh’s daughter and asked her if she should get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the
            child for her. She gave her consent and agreed to pay wages to the woman to nurse him. Miriam, took Moses to
            his mother, Jochebed and she nursed him until he was weaned and thereafter she turned him over to Pharaoh’s
            daughter (Exodus 2:2-10). Therefore, Moses was reared up in the house of Pharaoh’s daughter and was
            acquainted with the Egyptians arts and customs. At the age of 40, Moses slew an Egyptian and hid him in the
            sand for smiting a Hebrew. After becoming aware that Pharaoh would learn what he had done, Moses fled into
            the Land of Midian in the Wilderness of Sinai and married one of the seven daughters of Jethro, Zipporah.
            Her father Jethro was a priest in Midian and also owned a flock of sheep, and Moses became a shepherd
            (Exodus 2:11-22).

            After Moses, the shepherd, had been in the Wilderness for forty years, Yahweh FIRST APPEARED (in a Vision),
            in the form of Elohim, as an angel, IN THE MIDST OF THE BURNING BUSH to him (Moses) with the ROD in his hand
            (Exodus 3:2; Exodus 4:2-7, see also chart # 1, page 13). As Moses approached to investigate the BURNING
            BUSH, Yahweh-Elohim called unto him out of the MIDST OF THE BUSH, and said, “Moses, Moses! And he said, here
            am I. And He (Yahweh-Elohim) said, Draw NOT NIGH HITHER: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the PLACE
            whereon thou standest is HOLY GROUND. Moreover He said, I am the ELOHIM of thy father, the ELOHIM of
            Abraham, the ELOHIM of Isaac, and the ELOHIM of Jacob” (Exodus 3:4-6, H.N.B.).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Moses, ALONE (while still at the BURNING BUSH in the Wilderness) was instructed to go back down into Egypt
            to speak to the Israelites and Pharaoh. Yahweh-Elohim’s further introduction and commission or instruction
            to Moses: “And Elohim said unto Moses, AYAH-ASHER-AYAH” (I WILL BE WHAT I WILL TO BE — Exodus 3:14, which is
            the original Hebrew text, H.N.B., translated I AM THAT I AM in the K.J.V.). Yahweh-Elohim demonstrated to
            Moses that He would BE WHAT HE WILLED TO BE, when He commanded Moses to cast the rod, which he had in his
            hand, on the ground and it became a Serpent. Moses fled but Yahweh told him to put forth his hand and take
            it by the tail and it became a rod again. Yahweh demonstrated other miracles to Moses such as instructing
            him to “Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out,
            behold, his hand was leprous as snow. And He said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand
            into bosom again, and plucked it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his other flesh”
            (Exodus 4:2-7).
        </p>

        <p class="ti">

            And He said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I WILL BE hath sent me unto you. And Elohim
            said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, YAHWEH, the ELOHIM of your
            fathers, the ELOHIM of Abraham, the ELOHIM of Isaac, and the ELOHIM of Jacob hath sent me unto you: this is
            MY NAME FOREVER, and this is MY MEMORIAL unto ALL GENERATIONS. Go, and gather the elders of Israel,
            together, and say unto them, YAHWEH-ELOHIM of your fathers, the ELOHIM of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,
            appeared unto me, saying, I have surely REMEMBERED YOU AND SEEN THAT WHICH IS DONE TO YOU IN EGYPT. At this
            point Moses hesitated to go again into Egypt unto Pharaoh who Moses supposed was the Pharaoh (Rameses I),
            King of Egypt, that was reigning at the time when he (Moses) slew the Egyptian and fled into Midian in the
            wilderness some forty years earlier. However, Yahweh assured Moses that all the men which sought his life
            were dead, and that another Pharaoh (Rameses II - the typical man of sin or Son of Perdition of the 18th
            Dynasty - 666, see Rev. 13:18), was reigning who did not KNOW Moses and therefore would not seek his life
            (Exodus 4:19, see also Exodus 3:l0-22, and charts on page l3, concerning the above paragraphs).

            Firstly, YAHWEH spoke to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, or in other words the Patriarchs long BEFORE the time of
            Moses (but they never WROTE or DOCUMENTED any of their communications they had with Yahweh, neither did they
            KNOW HIS TRUE NAME): this was done verbally so, or through VISIONS to them as is stated in Exodus 6:3-5,
            H.N.B. thusly: “And I APPEARED UNTO ABRAHAM, unto ISAAC, and unto JACOB as EL SHADDI (Almighty Provider),
            but by MY NAME, YAHWEH, was I NOT KNOWN TO THEM. And I have also established MY COVENANT with them, to give
            them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. And I have also heard
            the groanings of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage: and I HAVE REMEMBERED MY
            COVENANT.” (See also Genesis 17:1; Genesis 35:11; Genesis 48:3).

            Moses, ordained and commissioned by Yahweh, left Midian with the ROD OF ELOHIM in his hand (Exodus 4:19-20);
            Zipporah, his wife and their two sons (whom his wife circumcised along the way) to return to Egypt. Yahweh
            at this time had INSTRUCTED Aaron, Moses’ brother to meet him in the Wilderness (Exodus 4:27), and go back
            into Egypt with him to be his mouthpiece or spokesman (Exodus 4:14, 28-31). Moses and Aaron did go back down
            into Egypt as Yahweh-Elohim had commissioned or instructed them, and while in Egypt they delivered the
            message to the Israelites, but before Pharaoh would let them that were born in Egypt depart, the TEN (10)
            DEVASTATING PLAGUES were poured out. Simultaneously with the pouring out of the tenth and last plague,

            the morning of the next day after the stygian night of the Passover, Elohim by the Phenomenal Cloud and the
            hand of Moses led the twelve tribes of Israel out of the plague stricken devastated chaotic land of Egypt
            early in the morning of the third day, through the MIRACULOUSLY DIVIDED WATERS of the Red Sea into the
            Wilderness, which was 1490 B.Y. This statement includes Elohim, the persons, date and the immediate
            geographical location involved in our explanation.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            On the 15th day of the second month (Zif) AFTER Israel came out of Egypt Yahweh established a SABBATH when
            He gave them MANNA to be gathered SIX DAYS and rest on the SEVENTH DAY (SABBATH - Exodus 16:15-26). Shortly
            after Moses was called into Mount Sinai the “FIRST TIME” and was instructed of Yahweh-Elohim to sanctify the
            people against the third day (which was June 6th), thereafter, YAHWEH-ELOHIM SPOKE TO ISRAEL from the CLOUD
            that covered the Mount the Ten Commandment Law the First Covenant or Testament at which time, simultaneously
            the Law was written on tables of stone in the Mount (see Exodus 20th chapter and also Plate # 2, on page 14
            ).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Thereafter, Moses wrote all of the words of YAHWEH-ELOHIM in a Book which He had spoken from the mount, he
            (Moses) took the blood of the Sacrifices of Bullocks which he had caught in basins and sprinkled half the
            Blood upon the Altar. Then he took the Book and READ it in the audience of the people: and they said all
            that Yahweh hath said will we do, and be obedient. Moses then took the other half of the Blood and sprinkled
            it on the BOOK and on the people, and said, Behold the Blood of the Covenant, which Yahweh hath made with
            you concerning all these words; this was the First Covenant with Israel (Exodus 24:4-8).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Yahweh-Elohim had already told Moses, before he had written all the words of the Covenant and dedicated both
            the Book and the people, to come up to (the plateau of) Mount Sinai the “SECOND TIME” and bring Aaron,
            Nadab, Abihu and the Seventy Elders of Israel and they should worship Him afar off, but Moses ALONE should
            come near Yahweh (Exodus 24:1-2). It was there on the plateau of the CLOUD COVERED Mount that they saw (in a
            vision) JOSHUA, the Elohim of Israel TRANSFIGURE into the SUPER INCORPOREAL FORM OF A MAN or as a GREAT
            HEAVENLY ANTHROPOMORPHIC BEING (see Exodus 24:9-10, and compare with Matthew 16:28; Matthew 17:1-13). This
            demonstrated, revelation was made to Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and the seventy elders of Israel at this TIME and
            PLACE because He wished them to know THEN and THEREAFTER that HE WAS THE ELOHIM of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
            or the Elohim of Israel, their Elohim as stated in the proceeding caption (see Genesis 17:1; Genesis 35:11;
            Genesis 48:3; I Kings 18:36; I Chronicles 29:18).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Thereafter, Moses and his Minister JOSHUA, rose up to ascend to the top of the Phenomenal Cloud covered
            mount to receive the two tables of stone with the Ten Commandments engraved with the finger of Elohim; but
            before Moses departed, he instructed Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and the seventy elders to TARRY THERE WHERE THEY
            WERE until he and Joshua returned from the top of the CLOUD COVERED MOUNT. However, when Moses and Joshua
            DID NOT RETURN according to the Israelites expectations, they DISOBEYED Moses’ instructions and descended
            from the plateau of the mount and became engaged in making and worshipping the GOLDEN CALF, which operation
            also resulted in breaking of the Commandments of Yahweh-Elohim, written by Moses in the Book of the Covenant
            and also engraved in the two Tables of Stone, which reads as follows: “And ELOHIM spake all these words,
            saying, I am YAHWEH THY ELOHIM, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
            bondage. Thou shalt have NO ELOHIM before Me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven idol, or any likeness
            of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the
            earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I YAHWEH THY ELOHIM am a jealous ELOHIM,
            visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
            hate Me: And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me, and keep My Commandments” (Exodus 20:1-6).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (NOTE: REMEMBER THIS DISOBEDIENCE TO MOSES’ COMMAND HAPPENED WHILE JOSHUA AND HE WERE STILL IN THE CLOUD
            COVERED MOUNT, which subject we will return to and DISCUSS AFTER OUR FURTHER CONTINUATION AND EXPLANATION OF
            OTHER VISIONS MOSES HAD WHILE JOSHUA AND HE REMAINED IN THE MOUNT).

            B - THE VISION OF THE THREE-FOLD ARCHETYPAL PATTERN IN RELATION TO THE THREE-FOLD TANGIBLE SANCTUARY
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            It was also in Mount Sinai that Moses received the VISION of the three-fold Archetype Pattern in relation to
            the three-fold Tangible Sanctuary (see plate # 4 on page 16 ). The VISION of the three-fold ARCHETYPAL
            PATTERN is explained in this way: ELOHIM, the Great Heavenly Anthropomorphic Incorporeal Being,
            instantaneously TRANSFORMED HIMSELF into a three-fold COMPLETELY FURNISHED, intangible Sanctuary so that
            Moses could SEE the total structure; with its Brazen Vesseled exterior furnishings and the Golden Vesseled
            interior furnishings therein, and also the interior hanging curtains and the departmental DIVIDING VAIL,
            lavishly embellished with Angelic Figures. Thus, in this way, ELOHIM was able to SHOW Moses the three-fold
            Intangible Sanctuary and make him thoroughly UNDERSTAND and retain in his MIND, how, thereafter, he was to
            build the (figurative) three-fold Tangible Sanctuary for a Dwelling Place for Him, Elohim, among the
            children of Israel (Exodus 25:8), fashioned like the PATTERN which Moses had SEEN in the Mount (Exodus
            25:40). This was necessary since YAHWEH, in His Supernal Nature is three-fold namely: (1) YAHWEH or the
            FATHER, (2) ELOHIM or THE WORD, and (3) YAHSHUA or the HOLY SPIRIT in personification, and these THREE ARE
            ONE (I John 5:7, K.J.V.), ALL IN ALL (I Corinthians 15:28) UNIVERSAL SUPREME SPIRIT EMBODIMENT in whom we
            live, move and have our being (Acts 17:28, see also Plate # 5 on page 17).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Therefore, the manifested TRANSFORMED STATE of the three-fold YAHWEH (Yahweh, Elohim or Yahshua), into the
            INTANGIBLE SANCTUARY or INCORPOREAL PATTERN, shown to Moses in the Mount, MUST BE three-fold or DIVIDED into
            THREE PARTS. These three parts are namely: (1) The Most Holy Place, (2) The Holy Place and (3) The Outer
            Court. This statement by John, “For there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and
            the Holy Spirit: and these three are one” (1 John 5:7, K.J.V.), along with Paul’s statement (Colossians
            2:9), “For in Him (Elohim or Yahshua) dwelleth all the fulness of the Supernal Nature of Yahweh in bodily
            form (Yahshua),” PROVES the much debated question by Christendom who say that the Supernal Nature (Godhead)
            consists of three individual persons, who agree in one; but the Pattern of the Tabernacle, and all things
            created in the Universe by the Pattern, PROVES that there are THREE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE ONE SPIRIT: Yahweh
            (invisible), Elohim (visible in visions) and Yahshua (visible).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            These manifested three-fold parts of the Tabernacle (with the Phenomenal Cloud standing above it) ARE IN
            REALITY ONE COMPLETE TABERNACLE herein called the INCORPOREAL PATTERN of the Universe with its contents
            which are as follows:

            THE VISION AND HISTORY OF THE CREATION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            (See Chart proving the Exodus BEFORE the Genesis, page 19, and Chart # 6, page 18). We have explained Exodus
            the 24th chapter from the 1st to the 15th verses, now we shall explain the 16th verse. Moses while still in
            the Mount and within the midst of the Cloud was shown another Vision. This time, beginning with Exodus
            24:16, He Elohim showed Moses a Panoramic Vision of the creation of Heaven and Earth. Elohim manifested
            Himself to Moses in an Incorporeal Form as the Creator of Heaven and Earth and all that in them is.
            Therefore, in this Vision, Moses HEARD and SAW within Six Solar Days, Elohim in the process of creation by
            Himself, the Pattern, each evening and morning or day by day in logical sequence until he had reached the
            Seventh Day. Moses wrote in Exodus 24:16, “And the Glory of Yahweh abode upon Mount Sinai and the CLOUD
            covered it six days: and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst the Cloud.”
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            It was here at the colon, after the six days in the 24th chapter of Exodus and the 16th verse in the year
            1490 B.Y., after Moses had led the children of Israel out of Egypt under the leadership of Yahweh- Elohim
            that Moses was called into Mount Sinai and was shown the VISION of the creation of Heaven and Earth, as is
            quoted by Moses in the first chapter of Genesis (see chart on the Exodus before the Genesis, page 19), which
            says: “In the beginning (of Moses’ Vision) ELOHIM created the Heavens and Earth.” Moses saw in the VISION in
            Genesis 1:33, H.N.B. THAT ON THE SEVENTH DAY ELOHIM completed His work and rested on the SEVENTH DAY from
            all His work which He had made. The record of the Creation in the first chapter is not a record of the
            actual creation but an account of Moses’ VISION which he had in Mount Sinai in the year 1490 B.B.Y. or 2513
            years (A.M.) after the first man ADAM.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            The fact that Moses was called into Mount Sinai in the year 1490 B.Y. and saw in a VISION the Creation of
            Heaven and Earth which he recorded in the first chapter of Genesis and confirmed by the three-fold Pattern
            of the Tabernacle, PROVES that the long sought mystery by Scientists, Theologians and Commentators of the
            record of the Creation, was not of Babylonian or Assyrian origin of Mythology, but was by a VISION shown to
            Moses in Mount Sinai in 1490 B.Y.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            If you will also note that Moses wrote in the 1st verse of the 2nd chapter of Genesis (H.N.B.) or the 4th
            verse of the 2nd chapter of Genesis (K.J.V.) quoted thusly: “These are the origins of the heavens and the
            earth when they were created in THE DAY (the DAY, singular) of Yahweh, the SOURCE and SUBSTANCE, in THE
            REALM OF ETERNITY, NOT IN TIME, that Yahweh-Elohim made the earth and the heavens,” having no beginning or
            ending (see chart, the Exodus BEFORE the Genesis, page 19). This vision of Moses which he SAW as related in
            the 24th chapter of Exodus in the year 1490 B.Y., and recorded in the 1st and 2nd chapters of Genesis is the
            answer to the long sought mystery by Scientists and Theologians as to how old and from what substance the
            Universe was created.

            THE VISIONS AND DESCENT OF MOSES FROM THE MOUNT AND THE BREAKING OF THE FIRST TWO TABLES OF STONE
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            During the first forty days that Moses along with his minister Joshua, were in the Mount, he (Moses) was
            shown all of the VISIONS, namely:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (1) The creation of Heaven and Earth, within SIX DAYS (Exodus 24:16; Genesis 1:1-31; Genesis 2:4, K.J.V. or

            which includes ADAM and EVE at PEACE or RESTING in the Garden of Eden, with the command “Thou shall not
            touch or eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil” (see chart on page 18).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (2) The BOOK which YAHWEH had written and kept, with all the names of mankind in which Moses saw his own

            (3) The three-fold INTANGIBLE TABERNACLE with instructions as to how he (Moses) thereafter was to build the
            TANGIBLE TABERNACLE in the Wilderness. Thereafter, he was to receive the FIRST TWO TABLES OF STONE written
            with the finger of ELOHIM and place them in the Ark of the Covenant. “And Yahweh said unto Moses, Go, get
            thee down: for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves”
            (Exodus 32:7). After Moses received the FIRST TWO TABLES OF STONE, Joshua told Moses that he heard a noise
            in the camp and for Moses to go down from the Mount (Exodus 32:17). As we have already stated, Moses DID NOT
            SEE the TRANSGRESSION in the Garden of Eden, BEFORE he and Joshua departed from the top of the cloud covered
            mount, with the FIRST two tables of stone in his hands. Arriving at the Plateau of the Mount (which was in
            seeing distance of the camp), where he (Moses) had instructed Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and the Seventy Elders to
            remain or tarry until he and Joshua returned, he discovered that they had DISOBEYED his command and returned
            to the camp and had built and was engaged in worshiping the GOLDEN CALF.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Moses seeing they (the stiff-necked children of Israel) had also DISOBEYED the Book of the Covenant which
            Moses sprinkled with the Blood of the sacrifices and also the Command “thou shalt not make unto thee any
            graven idol or any likeness of anything...” he (Moses justifiably WAXED HOT and threw down and broke the
            Tables of Stone containing the Ten Commandment Law from the plateau of the mount. These FIRST two Tables of
            Stone were to have been reserved and placed in the Ark of the Covenant (which at this time had not yet been
            built). Exodus 25:21; Exodus 26:34; Exodus 40:20; Hebrews 9:4, see pictures and charts on pages 14 through
            18.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            After the angry man Moses arrived within the camp he took the Golden Calf which they had made and burned it
            in the fire and ground it into powder and strew it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of
            it. Moses then questioned his brother Aaron to learn the reason for the Israelite apostasy, that is their
            departure from the mount and their DISOBEDIENCE in building and worshiping the Golden Calf, which Aaron
            explained to Moses that he and Joshua did not return according to their expectations, they became impatient
            and refused to tarry any longer. Therefore, they departed from the mount and demanded that Aaron allow them
            to collect the gold from one another, build and worship the Golden Calf. Moses told the Israelites that they
            had sinned a great sin. After receiving instructions from Elohim, Moses then told the Levites to arm
            themselves and go through all the gates of the camp and find out who was on Yahweh’s side, which they did
            and they SLEW about THREE THOUSAND of them that day (Exodus 32:27-28; Jude :5).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            After this, Moses consecrated the rest of the people and returned unto Yahweh to make atonement or
            intercession for their sins. He, Moses, said, Yet now if thou will forgive their sin; if not, BLOT ME, I
            PRAY THEE, OUT OF THE BOOK WHICH THOU HAST WRITTEN. And Yahweh said unto Moses, “Whosoever hath sinned
            against me, him will I BLOT OUT OF MY BOOK (Exodus 32:32-33).

            MOSES THIRD TRIP INTO THE MOUNT
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            Yahweh said unto Moses, Hew thee out TWO TABLES OF STONE LIKE UNTO THE FIRST and bring them up into the
            mount and I will write upon these Tables the words that were in the First Tables which thou breakest. Moses
            did all that Yahweh-Elohim had commanded before he ascended Mount Sinai with the second tables of stone
            (Exodus 34:4). While Moses was in the Cloud covered Mount this time Yahweh-Elohim (in a VISION, which was
            repeated in part) returned Moses’ ATTENTION back to Adam and Eve in perfect Peace, within the Garden of
            Eden, wherein also was the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which they were forbidden to eat thereof.
            This is where Moses left them at the end of his SECOND TRIP (see chart on page 21). NOTE: Some Theologians
            think this second reference to Adam and Eve, beginning in the second chapter of Genesis establishes a second
            account of the Creation, BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE. It was here at this time that Moses saw the Serpent that
            DECEIVED and caused the Transgression of Eve and the Sin and instantaneous DEATH of Adam in his conscience
            in the Garden of Eden. Thereafter, in the cool of that

            AME DAY or as the Sun went down, Moses saw the Angel with the “Flaming Sword” drive Adam the earthly Son of
            Yahweh-Elohim out of the Garden and the Woman, Eve, voluntarily went out with him. Thereafter, Moses saw (in
            the Vision) the birth of all the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve, and the rest of the generations of
            mankind that followed, which included the Patriarchs, and the Historical Events that he recorded in the Book
            of Genesis and a part of that which is recorded in the Book of Exodus. In order to express the same thought
            in a better understandable way, let us say here that Yahweh-Elohim brought Moses up to date while he was in
            the Mount.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Moses at the end of his forty day period descended from the Mount this THIRD and LAST TIME with the Second
            Tables of Stone, with the Commandments of Yahweh-Elohim written thereon, which signified the New Covenant
            with Israel (Exodus 34:29). He then directed the construction and dedication of the TABERNACLE and the
            Priesthood and their operation therein. He remained alive and saw the Israelites multiply one hundred fold
            during the forty years they were in the Wilderness, while all the rest of the Israelites that were born in
            Egypt died except Caleb, Eleazar and Phinehas.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            During this forty years Moses wrote or caused to be written, the five Books of the Law, Torah or Pentateuch,
            often referred to as the Books of the OLD TESTAMENT. Moses LAST and FINAL ERROR was made when he SMOTE the
            rock at Horeb instead of SPEAKING to it as Yahweh-Elohim had told him to do, so that the Israelites could
            have water to drink and for other purposes (Numbers 20:8-11).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Yahweh-Elohim then told Moses to write “the Song of Victory,” place Joshua in command of Israel, which he
            did, and then he would be permitted to go up into Mount Nebo and view the Promised Land. He died there at
            the age of one hundred and twenty (120) years. Yahweh buried him there (Deuteronomy chapters 31 thru 34).
            Joshua and the Israelites mourned Moses death thirty days and Joshua gave them three more days to prepare
            victuals and then they crossed over the divided waters of the River Jordan and invaded the Land of Canaan.
            In a course of time when they had conquered their enemies and reached Mount Zion, Joshua, Caleb, Eleazar and
            Phinehas divided the Land of Canaan among the Israelites. They left eight tribes or nations remain therein.
            Joshua died a natural death at the age of one hundred and ten (110) years in the border of his inheritance
            in Timnathserah, in Mount Ephraim (Joshua 24:29-30).

            WHAT, WHERE, WHEN and HOW He created or formed the Angelic Host and the Heaven and Earth, it is also

            (1) In the accompanying illustrations, Unity, part I and Eternity, pages 31 and 32, the author intends to
            show and prove the existence of Yahweh. Yahweh first existed (in totality) as Pure Spirit (John 4:24). That
            is to say, Yahweh is “The Ultimate Source, Infinite and Immaculate Substance, the Incomprehensible and
            Inscrutable Principle, the ALL IN ALL, an Eternal, Independent, Self Existing Deity without Visible Shape or
            Form” (Deuteronomy 4:12; John 5:37). Therefore, He is, within Himself, the sum total embodiment of “ALL” of
            the attributes of Intelligence, Wisdom, Knowledge, Love, Beauty, Justice, Foundation, Power and Strength. He
            is the Limit and Bounds, the Source and Substance. Yahweh is the “Terminus Ad quem and Terminus Ad quo.”

            (2) Next in the illustrations, Unity, part 2 and Super Incorporeal Form, pages 31 and 33, we are showing how
            that Yahweh, by the process of Transmutation, took on Super Incorporeal Form (in part, not in totality)
            before He began to create the Angelic Host. After the physical creation, Yahweh, in this Super Incorporeal
            Form (Elohim), was seen by Moses and the Prophets in Visions and communicated with them (see Exodus 24:9-10;
            Proverbs 8:22).

            In this condition He was the Universal Archetype Pattern of everything, “Incorporeal and Physical” that He

            34, we mean that in the Realm of Eternity, He created the Spirit Beings or the Angelic Host FIRST, BEFORE He
            created the Physical Creation. Angels are MINISTERING SPIRITS, created to Serve, Honor, Obey and Glorify
            Yahweh (see Daniel 3:28; 7:27; Luke 1:19; Hebrews 1:14). Lucifer, an angelic spirit creature, the Son of the
            Morning, because of his great Beauty and Wisdom, wherewith Elohim had created him, lifted himself up or
            rebelled against Yahweh. This caused a rebellion in Heaven among the Angels, and therefore, Lucifer and his
            host were found guilty before Elohim, and were cast out of Heaven into the Ethereal Darkness that surrounded
            the Earth after the beginning of the physical creation. This was the ORIGIN of Satan, the Evil Spirit

            (3) Finally In the illustrations, Unity, part 3, and Concrete Form, pages 31 and 35, Elohim took on Physical
            Shape and Form (in part, not in totality) manifested in the Material Creation and thereafter in Yahshua, as
            shown in Unity, part 3, page 31 (John 1:14; I Timothy 3:16; I John 5:20). To summarize as heretofore
            explained, this downward operation of process as indicated in Unity, page 31, shows Yahweh (in part, not in
            totality) coming from Pure Spirit, which is His Inconceivable and Incomprehensible State of existence,
            through Super Incorporeal Form and then into materialization of Spirit in Physical Bodily Form of Yahshua

            His Purpose to mankind to make a New Creation and a New Creature in Yahshua the Messiah (2 Corinthians

            THE SCIENTIFIC DISPUTATION OF THE BIBLICAL ACCOUNT OF THE CREATION
        </h4>
        <p class="ti">
            The world’s greatest intellectually-minded and academically trained Theologians openly confess that they
            cannot reconcile the Biblical account of the Creation in Genesis, chapter one to chapter two, verse four
            with the many scientific accounts of the creation of Heaven and Earth. Although, there are many points of
            which they disagree, we will limit this discussion to he following:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (1) The Biblical scholars cannot satisfactorily explain how that there was LIGHT BEFORE THE SUN, MOON and
            STARS WERE CREATED and placed in the Heavens on the Fourth day.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (2) The Religious Scholars cannot explain how that the VEGETATION CAME FORTH FROM THE GROUND AND GREW INTO
            FRUITION ON THE THIRD DAY BEFORE THE SUN WAS PLACED IN THE HEAVENS ON THE FOURTH DAY OF CREATION.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (3) The Biblical account that vegetation was complete in all of its forms on the Third day of the Creation
            before any animal life appeared on the fifth and sixth day of Creation is not understood nor can be
            explained.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            These points of contention are mentioned in Funk and Wagnall New Standard Bible Dictionary Third Revised
            Edition, under the caption, “COSMOGONY”, page 152; here, fifty-nine contributors of the world’s best known
            Biblical scholars plainly admit that they cannot reconcile the Biblical account of Creation with accepted
            scientific belief and concepts because of the following reasons:
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (a) Science recognizes the SUN AS THE SOURCE OF LIGHT and it is necessary for the GROWTH AND PROPAGATION OF
            ALL PLANT LIFE.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            (b) Science teaches that PLANT and ANIMAL LIFE EXISTS in a SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP, where one cannot thrive
            without the other.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            The utter failure on the part of these astute and worldly-trained Biblicists to dissolve their differences
            with the scientists is due mainly to the fact that they try to explain the Creation without recognizing and
            acknowledging the Creator who is the True SON of YAHWEH (ELOHIM). HOW CAN THERE BE A CREATION WITHOUT A
            CREATOR?
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            We have fully explained elsewhere in this book (see the chart of Moses’ Vision, page l8) that Moses received
            a Vision of the Creation while he was in the Cloud that covered the top of Mount Sinai for six days in the
            year 1490 B.Y. (before Yahshua the Messiah), after he had brought the children of Israel out of Egypt
            (Exodus 24:16). Moses was accompanied in Mount Sinai by JOSHUA the Son of Nun, who in fact was YAHSHUA
            (Numbers 13:8-16), who TRANSFIGURED before Moses (see Matthew 17:1-9). Thus, it was this Anthropomorphic
            Form of Joshua (or Elohim), who

            DEMONSTRATED to Moses in his VISION that He was the True Creator of the Heavens and Earth and all that in
            them is. This Vision of Moses took place in the Realm of Eternity and not in the Realm of TIME as typified
            by his entering into the midst of the Cloud denoting pure Spirit or the Eternity of Yahweh.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            It was this same JOSHUA who was with Moses and Aaron and the children of Israel down in Egypt and He was the
            Phenomenal Light that lit up the Land of Goshen where the Israelites had light in their dwellings, whereas
            throughout the rest of the land of Egypt, there was the plague of stygian black darkness. Furthermore, this
            same JOSHUA was that Phenomenal Cloud that furnished light unto the Israelites during their three day march
            to and through the Red Sea, and at the same time was absolute pitch-black darkness, to the pursuing host of
            Pharaoh. This phenomenal cloud went from before Israel and stood between Israel and Pharaoh and his host,
            thus one can see the division between Light and Darkness during the three days of the Migration out of Egypt
            and to and through the Red Sea. This same situation must be repeated so that there is definite and positive
            proof of its occurrence, so then Moses in his vision atop Mount Sinai of the migration of the Physical
            Creation out of Pure Spirit, we must see the existence of cosmic light and the dividing of the light and
            darkness during the first three days of the Creation; but let us please keep in mind that the origin of this
            light is JOSHUA (or Yahshua) and please let us be reminded that this is not Cosmic Light but the Light of
            the SON OF YAHWEH. When Yahshua the Messiah (who was the Son of Yahweh) spoke to the Jews during the 31⁄2
            years of His ministry, He told them that He was the LIGHT of the world (John 9:5). In further confirmation
            of this fact, John in his Vision on the Isle of Patmos, who wrote of Yahshua the Messiah in the book of
            Revelation, “and the City (Jerusalem above) had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it: for
            the glory of Yahweh (Elohim) did lighten it, and the LAMB is the LIGHT thereof” (Revelation 21:23).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            These academically trained Theologians failed to differentiate between the SON of Yahweh and the SUN in the
            sky which is only a reflection or a type or shadow of the REAL SON (Elohim). Yet, there is a definite
            relationship between the two, as is clearly shown by Yahweh-Elohim’s waiting until the cool of the evening
            as the SUN in the sky was going down to cast Adam, the SON of Yahweh (Luke 3:38) out of the Garden of Eden
            into outer darkness after his SIN. Here we can see that the two, (the Sun in the sky and the Son of Yahweh)
            are going down together. Likewise, as Yahshua the Messiah was dying on the cross and all of the Life (or
            Light) was draining out of His physical body, the Sun in the sky began to darken and to go down into stygian
            black darkness from the sixth to the ninth hour. Here again, the Sun in the sky is coordinated with the SON
            of Yahweh as the two go on down together. Then, three days later, as it began to dawn toward the first day
            of the week, that is, as the Sun in the sky was coming up, the Son of Yahweh (Yahshua) rose from the grave
            thus accomplishing the rising of the two (Son and Sun) together.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Malachi confirms that these two Suns (Son and Sun), are one and the same, for he wrote, “But unto you that
            revere my Name, shall the SUN of righteousness arise with healing in His wings” (Malachi 4:2). Here, the
            Prophet Malachi is plainly referring to Yahshua the Messiah, the SON OF YAHWEH, but he refers to Him as the
            SUN. Thus, it is plain to those who have the eyes to see, that ELOHIM the SON of YAHWEH was the beginning of
            the Creation of Yahweh (Revelation 3:14), and Creator of Heaven and Earth (John 1:1-2; Colossians 1:13-17),
            and He was before all things, including the Sun which was placed in the Heaven on the Fourth day to be a
            witness of Yahshua the Messiah, the fleshly SON of Yahweh, who was placed in the earth plane in the 4000th
            year after the Adamic man was driven out of the Garden of Eden. (Remember that one day with Yahweh is as a
            thousand years, and a thousand years is as one day — Psalms 90:4; II Peter 3:8). This Elohim (or Joshua) who
            spoke to Moses at the Burning Bush told him that he should tell Pharaoh and the Israelites in Egypt that He
            was AYAH ASHER AYAH (which means I WILL BE WHAT I WILL TO BE). Thus He willed to be the SUN, MOON and STARS,
            and in fact, the UNIVERSE in its TOTALITY IS ONE OR ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF HIM (YAHWEH- ELOHIM). It is
            therefore no trouble for one to see how there was LIGHT before the SUN was placed in the Heavens on the
            Fourth day, for we see the SON of Yahweh (Elohim), who is the LIGHT OF THE WORLD.

            seed of Abraham (the children of Israel) came up out of Egypt and were Baptized in the Cloud and the Sea the
            third day; but let us remember that Joshua (Moses’ minister) was right along with them and He was the one
            who delivered them out of Egypt (see Joshua 24th chapter). Therefore, that which caused the seed of
            vegetation to grow up without the aid of the ethereal Sun in the Heavens, is the same SON which caused the
            seed of Abraham to rise up out of Egypt and go on through the Wilderness into Canaan Land. Likewise, that
            which raised the Messiah from the dead on the third day was not the physical SUN in the sky, but ELOHIM, the
            Incorporeal or Anthropomorphic Form or SON of Yahweh (see Acts 3:13-15).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Truly, the vegetable kingdom coming forth on the third day, typifies the Angelic Creation whereas the animal
            kingdom coming forth later typifies the earthly or physical creation, and as angels are ministering spirits
            which are incarnated in all mankind and are inseparable from mankind, so must the vegetable and animal
            kingdoms be inseparably related. The plants exist on the carbon dioxide excreted by animals, and the animals
            exist on the oxygen liberated from the plants but both vegetable and animal life are dependent upon the SON
            (or SUN) which is the source of all life. The Apostle Paul wrote that Yahshua the Messiah who raised from
            the dead on the third day was the firstfruits of them that slept (I Corinthians 15:20), and after His
            resurrection, many of the saints (or Sons of Yahweh), who slept in the dust of the earth arose and went on
            into Jerusalem (Matthew 27:52-53).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            As we have already said heretofore, when one begins to read the book of Genesis he MUST realize that he is
            reading an account of the VISION that Moses had in the year 1490 B.Y. in the Cloud atop Mount Sinai.
            Yahweh-Elohim is showing Moses in a Vision how He had already created the Heavens and the Earth, for Moses
            was standing on physical Mount Sinai and furthermore, Moses himself is not conscious of any time whatsoever,
            as he is viewing a RERUN of the Creation of Heaven and Earth in the Realm of Eternity. Moses’ account of the
            Creation with the Divine Pattern of the Tabernacle which he also received confirms that Yahweh-Elohim is the
            ARCHETYPAL OR ORIGINAL PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSE and CONCLUSIVELY PROVES HIM to be AYAH ASHER AYAH, or I WILL
            BE WHAT I WILL TO BE. The whole Universal Creation witnesses to this, and this is the purpose for which it
            was created. Thus, we have shown WHEN, WHERE, HOW and WHY, Moses received the Vision of the Creation, and
            this is Scientifically and Scripturally proven by the Universe in all of its manifestations and the Holy
            Scriptures.

            It should be an eye-opener to all of the world seeing that all of these deep esoteric secrets of YAHWEH (who
            is a great mystery - I Timothy 3:16), are being explained and revealed to all that will accept the Truth.
            This positively points to the fact that this Age is almost ready to come to a close, as the Apostle John
            wrote, “But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, THE MYSTERY OF
            YAHWEH should be finished, as He hath declared to His servants the Prophets” (Revelation 10:7).

            SUMMARY
        </h3>
        <p class="ti">
            In the initial production of matter, it must FIRST appear in the Beginning of Moses’ vision as a parent mass
            of conglomeration or amalgamation of inorganic substance without particular descriptive shape or form or
            chaotic condition (Genesis 1:2), as evidenced by the dark, chaotic, plague stricken land of Egypt in the
            beginning of the Migration (Exodus 11:1-6).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Matter, in the second state, must take on descriptive shape and organic form to prove the invisible is
            understood by the visible (Romans 1:19-20), as evidenced by the building of the physical Tabernacle in the
            Wilderness (Exodus chapter 25 through 30), in harmony with the creation of the greater and more perfect
            Tabernacle, the Universe (Genesis chapter 1).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Matter then must be animated as evidenced by the physical Tabernacle being filled with the Spirit (breath of
            life) as shown by the Cloud covering the Tabernacle (outside and inside) Exodus 40:34-36, and further proven
            by Yahweh-Elohim breathing into the nostrils of both beast and man the Breath of Life (Genesis 2:7,19 also
            Genesis 7:21-22), and confirmed after the resurrection of Yahshua the Messiah when He breathed on His
            disciples and said to them, “Receive Ye the Holy Spirit” (John 20:22); which they did receive on the Day of
            Pentecost, as evidenced by the Mighty Rushing Wind, which filled them and the whole house whereby they were
            (Acts 2:4).

            Thus, this esoteric and exotic secret was revealed to Solomon and expressed in these words, “Yahweh
            possessed me in the BEGINNING of His way, BEFORE HIS WORKS OF OLD. I was set up from EVERLASTING, from the
            BEGINNING, or EVER THE EARTH WAS. When there WERE NO DEPTHS, I was brought forth; when there WERE NO
            FOUNTAINS ABOUNDING WITH WATER. Before the mountains were SETTLED, BEFORE THE HILLS WAS I BROUGHT FORTH:
            While as YET HE HAD NOT MADE THE EARTH, NOR THE FIELDS, NOR THE HIGHEST PART OF THE DUST OF THE WORLD. When
            He prepared the heavens, I WAS THERE: when He set a compass upon the face of the depth. When He established
            the clouds above. When He strengthened the fountains of the deep. When He gave to the sea His decree, that
            the waters should not pass His COMMANDMENT: WHEN HE APPOINTED THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH: THEN I WAS BY
            HIM, AS ONE BROUGHT UP WITH HIM” (Proverbs 8:22-30). The above statement of Solomon agrees with the
            Revelation of John which reads as follows: “And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These
            things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of Elohim (Revelation
            3:14 and also see John 1:1-14).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Whereas Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu and the seventy elders, after ascending Mount Sinai, SAW (in a vision)
            Yahshua the Messiah this Super Incorporeal Form whom they recognized as the Elohim of Israel; (“And they saw
            the Elohim of Israel; and there was under His feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it
            were the Body of Heaven in His clearness” - Exodus 24:10), BEFORE Moses entered into the midst of the Cloud,
            which typified his entrance into the presence of Elohim in “THE REALM OF ETERNITY”, wherein Moses HEARD the
            spoken words of Elohim, BEFORE TIME BEGAN, which SPONTANEOUSLY transformed Spirit or substance, in part,
            into a large super mass of inorganic and inanimate matter.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            “FOR HE SPAKE, AND IT WAS DONE; HE COMMANDED, AND IT STOOD FAST” (Psalms 33:9). “Through faith we understand
            that the WORLDS WERE FRAMED BY THE WORD OF YAHWEH SO THAT THINGS WHICH ARE SEEN WERE NOT MADE OF THINGS
            WHICH DO APPEAR” (Hebrews 11:3). With the Heaven (space) and Earth in this condition, Moses “SAW,”
            recognized and said, “In the beginning (of his vision) Elohim created the Heaven and Earth” (Genesis 1:1).
            If we, as scientists, engaged in an extensive and intensified research, thoroughly understood by Divine
            Interpretation that Yahweh is Spirit (John 4:24) inhabiting Eternity (Isaiah 57:15), and that Yahweh-Elohim
            created MATTER and that MATTER IS SPIRIT MATERIALIZED, which materialization took place SPONTANEOUSLY, in
            the Realm of Eternity, BEFORE TIME BEGAN and still continues to abide within this Eternal Realm, then we
            could very easily UNDERSTAND that there is no solution to the Age-old problem and question of “HOW OLD THE
            HEAVEN AND EARTH IS.” Actually, we must UNDERSTAND that we CANNOT TIME, or calculate the Age of Creation by
            the physical objects of the Creation, such as the operation of the Sun, Moon and Stars, when it is the
            repeated routine function of these previously created objects that make up what we call “TIME.” Or in other
            words, we cannot take the created objects which are necessary to establish TIME, to TIME their own creation.
            Therefore, scientists never will by Geological, Archeological and other methods of scientific research,
            including OUTER SPACE EXPLORATION, be able to determine the Age of the Creation, without FIRST determining
            the AGE of the ETERNAL CREATOR, Yahweh, because, as we have already explained, MATTER IS SPIRIT
            MATERIALIZED. For example, A watch is made to tell TIME, in seconds, minutes and hours, but it was not made
            to TELL HOW OLD THE WATCH itself is, <span class="u">or</span> <span class="u">the</span> <span

            A more detailed account of Moses’ VISION OF THE CREATION is more fully explained herein: “Moses went into

            of Israel (no night in the Holy Place in the Earthly Sanctuary, compare with Revelation 21:l-23). And Moses
            went into the MIDST of the CLOUD, and gat him up into the Mount: and Moses was in the Mount forty days and

            To summarize the (c) section under the caption of the EXPLANATION, we are referring to THE VISION AND
            HISTORY OF THE CREATION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH and ELOHIM’S REST OR SABBATH DAY.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Yahweh inhabits ETERNITY (Isaiah 57:15), as indicated by His Super Incorporeal Form, WITHIN THE CLOUD, that
            covered Mount Sinai. Hence, the actual CREATION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH must emanate from Yahweh and TAKE PLACE
            IN THE REALM OF ETERNITY. Therefore, these created physical objects such as the Sun, Moon, Stars and other
            Planets function within the REALM OF ETERNITY and cause the REALM OF TIME TO EXIST.
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            Moses, having first seen Elohim (in the Vision) before He began to create, therefore, SAW the entire process
            of the CREATION. When he began to write, starting with the beginning of the VISION, he wrote: “In the
            beginning Elohim created the HEAVEN AND THE EARTH” (Genesis 1:1).

        <p class="ti">
            This Panoramic Vision of Elohim in the process of creation which Moses SAW while he was “WITHIN THE CLOUD,”
            symbolizes his presence within “THE DAY” or within “ETERNITY” during the first SIX SOLAR DAYS of the forty
            day period that he was in Mount Sinai. This was in the third (Sacred) month, Sivan (comparable to our June),
            and year of 2513 A.M. or 1490 B.Y., and was recorded AS IS, in the first part of the BOOK OF GENESIS. As
            Moses was a witness, through the Vision of the creation we can understand HOW he could WRITE THE HISTORY OF
            THE CREATION OF THE HEAVEN AND EARTH and compile the BOOK OF GENESIS.

            Regarding the “SABBATH DAY” as a day of rest for mankind to keep, it is easy to see and clearly
            understandable that, since Moses WROTE the Book of Genesis in the Wilderness of Sinai in l490 B.Y. and
            placed the VISION, which he SAW in the Mount, in the first part of the Book of Genesis, AS IS; neither Adam
            nor any other of the Ante-diluvian or Post-diluvian Patriarchs prior to Moses could have known anything
            about the SABBATH DAY. In the second month (Exodus 16:1) after their arrival and residence in the Wilderness
            of Sinai, the Israelites began to murmur for food and for six days Elohim gave them manna from Heaven
            (Exodus 16:23-28). They were to gather enough on the sixth day to supply them during the SEVENTH DAY or THE
            SABBATH. It was here in the Wilderness of Sinai at this time, 1490 B.Y., that for the first time in the
            History of the World Elohim FIRST mentioned to mankind anything about the REST or the SEVENTH DAY, or the
            keeping of A SABBATH DAY. Elohim in speaking the Commandments from Mount Sinai, in the third month (Exodus
            19:1) THEREAFTER, reminded the Israelites to remember the SABBATH DAY to keep it HOLY. After speaking the
            Commandments from Mount Sinai, Elohim called Moses up into the Mount which the CLOUD covered SIX SOLAR DAYS,
            and Moses SAW Elohim in the process of CREATING THE HEAVEN AND EARTH (Genesis 1:1-31 and Genesis 2:1-4,
            K.J.V.).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            It was here in Mount Sinai that Yahweh (who, as already explained is Spirit) took on the Super Incorporeal
            Form of a man (Exodus 24:10; Ezekiel 1:26) and appeared to Moses in “A VISION”. Thereafter, the transmutable
            part of Spirit (or the three-fold “Godhead”) was spontaneously transformed into the APPARENT ethereal
            Darkness and Chaotic physical SUBSTANCE which Moses SAW and recognized to be the “Heaven and Earth” (Genesis
            1:1). Paradoxical as it may seem, John, in his Vision on the Isle of Patmos stated that the “Lamb of Yahweh”
            was slain “From the Foundation of the World” (Revelation l3:8; Revelation 17:8), which means that the
            “Paschal Lamb” in the Dark Chaotic Land of Egypt had to be slain therein “From the Beginning of the
            migration or departure of the Israelites from Egypt.” Thus, the Heaven and Earth which Moses SAW in the

            the CLOUD was in the same Dark Chaotic condition as the Land of Egypt AFTER the pouring out of the “Ten Plagues” and the offering and Blood of the “Paschal Lamb” BEFORE the BEGINNING of the Israelites departure therefrom (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=12#v1__14">Exodus 12:1-15</a>).

        <p class="ti">
            In this “COMPARATIVE TYPE” we are using the Red Sea for a boundary line between Egypt and the Wilderness of Sinai. In other words, we are using the Mystic Darkness and waters of the Red Sea to completely surround the Plague stricken Chaotic Land of Egypt, as described in the beginning of Moses’ VISION OF THE CREATION in <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v1__30">Genesis 1:1-31</a>. (See and compare <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v2">Genesis 1:2</a> with <a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=2&chapter=10#v21__2">Exodus 10:21-23</a>). From within this ethereal Darkness and Chaotic MASS Moses HEARD Elohim speak the words, “Let there be light: and there WAS LIGHT” (<a href="/bible.html?bookNumber=1&chapter=1#v3">Genesis 1:3</a>).
        </p>
        <p class="ti">
            After the dawn of Cosmic Light and from within this great CHAOTIC MASS Moses “SAW” Elohim (the Heavenly Anthropomorphic Being or Three-fold Archetype Pattern), systematically create the HEAVEN and EARTH with its vegetable and animal kingdoms as Moses knew them before, and as we now know them.

        <p class="ti">
            In this VISION Elohim, in “Speaking and Dealing” with this PARENT MASS, during these SIX (SOLAR) DAYS, thoroughly demonstrated that He is “UNIVERSAL SPIRIT LAW and ORDER WITHIN HIMSELF.” Whereas, on the SEVENTH DAY He rested and Sanctified that DAY because in it He RESTED FROM HIS WORK OF CREATION (<a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-Chapter-2/" target="_blank">Genesis 2:1-, K.J.V.3</a>).
